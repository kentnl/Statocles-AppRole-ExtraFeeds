Statocles::AppRole::ExtraFeeds

This module is a role that can be applied to any "Statocles::App" in a
"Statocles"'s "Beam::Wire" configuration.

  ...
  blog_app:
    class: 'Statocles::App::Blog'
    with: 'Statocles::AppRole::ExtraFeeds'
    args:
      url_root: '/blog'
      # ... more Statocles::App::Blog args
      extra_feeds:
        fulltext.rss:
          text: "RSS FullText"

This example creates a feed called "/blog/fulltext.rss" containing the
contents of "theme/blog/fulltext.rss.ep" after template application, and
is linked from every "index" listing.

It also creates a feed called "/blog/tag/<%= tagname %>.fulltext.rss"
for each tag, provisioned from the same template.
