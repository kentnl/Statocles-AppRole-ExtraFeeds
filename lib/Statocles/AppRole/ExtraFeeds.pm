=head1 EXPERIMENTAL

This module is very new and it comes with the following present caveats:

=over 4

=item * Application outside C<Statocles::App::Blog> untested.

Feedback welcome though, and it might work by magic!

=item * Implementation details a bit sketchy

The code works. I kinda feel like it shouldn't, and its like I've performed some magic
trick and the gods have smiled on me for a moment.

=item * You're on your own with templates

This at present is a glorified lump of glue on top of existing C<Statocles> behavior.

As such, if you want this to work, you'll probably want to copy some templates and modify them.

This module does nothing for you in terms of the actual formatting, it just pumps the right
glue so that the same code that generates the existing feeds will be invoked a few more times
but with the file names and templates you chose ( instead of the ones provided by default by the app )

Basically, you're going to want to copy C<blog/index.rss.ep> to C<blog/fulltext.rss.ep> and tweak
it a bit, or something.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a role that can be applied to any C<Statocles::App> in a C<Statocles>'s C<Beam::Wire>
configuration.

  ...
  blog_app:
    class: 'Statocles::App::Blog'
    with: 'Statocles::AppRole::ExtraFeeds'
    args:
      url_root: '/blog'
      # ... more Statocles::App::Blog args
      extra_feeds:
        fulltext.rss:
          text: "RSS FullText"

This example creates a feed called C</blog/fulltext.rss> containing the contents of C<theme/blog/fulltext.rss.ep>
after template application, and is linked from every C<index> listing.

It also creates a feed called C<< /blog/tag/<%= tagname %>.fulltext.rss >> for each tag, provisioned from the same template.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=head2 C<extra_feeds>

This Role provides one tunable parameter on its applied class, C<extra_feeds>, which contains a
mapping of

  id => spec

=head3 C<extra_feeds> spec.

  {
    text      => required
    name      => default( id )
    template  => default( id )
  }

=head4 C<text>

This is the name of the feed when shown in links on both C<index> and C<tag index> pages.

=head4 C<template>

This is the name of the template to render the feeds content into.

Defaults to taking the same value as the key in the C<extra_fields> hash.

=head4 C<name>

This is the name of the file/file suffix that is generated.

It defaults to the same value as the key in the C<extra_feeds>
hash.

So:

  extra_feeds:
    fulltext.rss:
      text: "My FullText RSS"

And

  extra_feeds:
    genericlabel:
      text: "My FullText RSS"
      name: 'fulltext.rss'      # output name
      template: 'fulltext.rss'  # source template

Should both generate the same result.
